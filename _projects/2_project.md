SuperIQ is a revolutionary low-light imaging solution on Android devices. It provides ultra-clean,
detail-rich imagery in dark environments, providing an exceptional photography experience for
consumers. At its core lies our efficient, mobile-friendly RAW image denoising technique based on deep neural networks, which won the NTIRE 2019 Challenge on Real Image Denoising. It has been
shipped with millions of Android smart phones since 2019.
