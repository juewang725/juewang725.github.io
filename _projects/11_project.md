Perhaps the most exciting new feature in After Effects CS5.5 is the [Warp Stabilizer effect](http://blogs.adobe.com/toddkopriva/2011/04/warp-stabilizer-in-after-effects-cs5-5.html). 
This effect automatically stabilizes a shot, removing unwanted motion. It is based on our research on subspace video stabilization, presented at SIGGRAPH 2011. 
Chris and Trish Meyer reviewed the Warp Stabilizer effect on the [ProVideo Coalition website](http://provideocoalition.com/index.php/cmg_keyframes/story/after_effects_cs5.5/P1/).

This feature was recently used by the VFX team behind the Oscar winner Hugo. Watch the Hugo interview [here](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/moving-to-adobe-premiere-pro-/hugo-filmmaking-past-informs-filmmaking-future/).
