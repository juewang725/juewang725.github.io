Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been extensively applied in a national park in
northwest China to track snow leopards inhabiting the region. The AI-aided digital toolbox
can automatically distinguish the species in the Qilian Mountains National Park,
Gansu Province, from other wildlife, using images captured by infrared cameras. The technology,
jointly developed by Chinese internet giant Tencent, the World Wild Fund and One Planet
Foundation, can thus improve data processing efficiency.
