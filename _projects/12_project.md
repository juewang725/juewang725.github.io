The all new Roto Brush tool in After Effects CS5 is largely based on our research on [video SnapCut](https://juew.org/37-2/tech-transfer/projects/SnapCut/snapcut.htm), and my previous research on image and video matting.   
A great tutorial video is [here](http://www.motionworks.com.au/2010/04/aecs5-roto-brush/).
