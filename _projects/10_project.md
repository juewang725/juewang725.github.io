Scribble Selection is one of the shinning features of [Adobe Photoshop Touch App](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-touch.html), available for
both iPad and Android Tablets. I designed and developed the main algorithm behind this feature.  

John Nack, former Product Manger of Photoshop Touch commented on this feature:
"If I had to boil the app down to one feature, it is this: Take two images, remove the background
from one, and then blend the two images together to create a new scene. The Scribble Selection
tool lets you use your finger or a stylus to quickly draw on the foreground object you want to keep and the background you want to delete. Then tap Extract, and the background disappears."

A popular Youtube video demo of the tool is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=89hej8N1Me0).
