Shake Reduction is a tool that can take a photo that is blurry due to camera
shake, calculate the movements that caused the blur, and "reverse it" to create a sharper
photo. It also has a completely automatic workflow that no one has ever seen before:
meaning that the tool is smart enough to adapt itself to a new input image in order to
create a good result. It does not work in every case, but when it works, it is amazing!
